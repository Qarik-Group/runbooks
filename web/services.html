    <h1>Blacksmith Services</h1>
    <h2></h2>
  </header>

  <div id="m">
    <p>On-demand and shared services are provided by Blacksmith.
Blacksmith is a service broker for Cloud Foundry that uses a
dedicated BOSH director to deploy actual VMs in response to
service provisioning requests.  If a CF user wants a PostgreSQL
box all to themselves, Blacksmith will do so.</p>
<p>The <em>magic</em> of Blacksmith is accomplished by way of <em>Forges</em>,
small bits of configuration, packaged up as a BOSH release, that
can be added into a Blacksmith deployment.</p>
<p>The Blacksmith Genesis Kit packages five forges at the moment:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://github.com/blacksmith-community/redis-forge-boshrelease">Redis</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/blacksmith-community/rabbitmq-forge-boshrelease">RabbitMQ</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/blacksmith-community/postgresql-forge-boshrelease">PostgreSQL</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/blacksmith-community/mariadb-forge-boshrelease">MariaDB</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/blacksmith-community/kubernetes-forge-boshrelease">Kubernetes</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Refer to their specific project pages for more details information
on their features and configuration.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/genesis-community/blacksmith-genesis-kit">Blacksmith Kit documentation</a> explains how to
configure each of these Forges and their service offerings.</p>
<h2>Get information about your Blacksmith</h2>
<p>If deployed with Genesis, <code>genesis info my-env</code> will dump most of the relevant
information for the deployment. This includes general env and deployment
information, URLs and creds for the bosh director and UI, and the
catalog of services.</p>

</code></pre>
<h2>Register a Blacksmith Broker</h2>
<p>Before your Cloud Foundry users can start provisioning services
via your new Blacksmith, it has to be registered with Cloud
Foundry, and enabled in the CF marketplace.</p>
<p>The <code>register</code> Genesis kit addon makes this easy.</p>
<pre><code>$ genesis do my-env register
Running register addon for my-env
authenticating to https://api.system.10.128.80.140.netip.cc as admin...
Setting api endpoint to https://api.system.10.128.80.140.netip.cc...

 ...
</code></pre>
<p>You can verify that the broker is registered, by checking that it
is listed in the output of <code>cf service-brokers</code></p>
<p>For more details, refer to <a href="https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/services/managing-service-brokers.html">Managing Service Brokers</a>, in
the official Cloud Foundry documentation.</p>
<p>This makes all the plans and services owned by the
<code>your-env-name-blacksmith</code> broker available to all orgs and spaces
in your Cloud Foundry instance.  If you need stricter permissions,
check the <a href="https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/services/access-control.html#enable-access">Marketplace Access Control</a> section of the
official Cloud Foundry documentation.</p>
<p>You can verify the publication of your Blacksmith brokerâ€™s plans
by running <code>cf marketplace</code> and checking that you see the plans
you defined in your Blacksmith manifests.</p>
<h2>Access the Blacksmith Management UI</h2>
<p>The Blacksmith Management Web UI provides an overview of what is
going on with a single Blacksmith Services Broker.</p>
<p>You can get the UI by using the <code>visit</code> addon</p>
<pre><code>$ genesis do my-env visit
Running visit addon for my-env
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>visit</code> addon will perform auth for you. If for any reason, you need to
auth manually, all of Blacksmith is protected by HTTP basic authentication.<br>
The username is always <code>blacksmith</code>, and the password can be found in
your Vault:</p>
<pre><code>$ safe read secret/my/env/blacksmith/broker:password
</code></pre>
<p>The UI lists the current catalog:</p>
<p><img src="images/services/catalog.png" alt="Catalog Listing"></p>
<p>It also lists all deployed instances:</p>
<p><img src="images/services/services.png" alt="Services Listing"></p>
<p>Finally, the last 8,000 (or so) log lines are buffered and printed
to the <em>Log</em> section:</p>
<p><img src="images/services/logs.png" alt="Blacksmith Logs"></p>
<h2>Provision a Service via <code>cf</code></h2>
<p>Cloud Foundry users can create new services using the standard
process, with the <code>cf</code> command-line utility:</p>
<pre><code>$ cf create-service dedicated-redis standalone my-kvstore
</code></pre>
<p>This will create a dedicated Redis instance, as a standalone,
single-VM deployment.  The name of the service (which is
arbitrary) will be <code>my-kvstore</code>.</p>
<p>Blacksmith is an asynchronous service broker, so the
<code>create-service</code> operation will return immediately, but the
service will be marked as <em>in progress</em>, until the Blacksmith BOSH
director has finished deploying it.  You can check on the progress
by issuing:</p>
<pre><code>$ cf service my-kvstore
</code></pre>
<p>Once the service is created, it can be bound to an application:</p>
<pre><code>$ cf bind-service key-value-app my-kvstore
</code></pre>
<p>The first argument is the application name (from a <code>cf push</code>), and
the second argument is the name we gave the service in our <code>cf create-service</code> call.</p>
<p>For more in-depth review of Cloud Foundry services and
applications, check the <a href="https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/services/">Service Overview</a> in the official
Cloud Foundry documentation.</p>
<h2>Remove a Service via <code>cf</code></h2>
<p>To remove a service, Cloud Foundry users should use the standard
<code>cf</code> command-line utility.</p>
<p>First, get a list of services provisioned in the current space:</p>
<pre><code>$ cf services
</code></pre>
<p>If the service you want is bound to any applications, it will need
to be unbound before it can be deleted:</p>
<pre><code>$ cf unbind-service app-name service-name
</code></pre>
<p>Then, it can be deleted:</p>
<pre><code>$ cf delete-service service-name
</code></pre>
<p>Blacksmith is an asynchronous service broker, so the
<code>delete-service</code> operation will return immediately, but the
service will be marked as <em>in progress</em>, until the Blacksmith BOSH
director has finished deploying it.  You can check on the progress
by issuing:</p>
<pre><code>$ cf service service-name
</code></pre>
<p>but be aware that once the operation succeeds, the service
information will be purged from the Cloud Foundry database, so <code>cf service</code> will start failing because the service is unknown.</p>
<p>For more in-depth review of Cloud Foundry services and
applications, check the <a href="https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/services/">Service Overview</a> in the official
Cloud Foundry documentation.</p>
<h2>Install <code>boss</code></h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/jhunt/boss">boss</a> is a command-line utility for interacting with blacksmith.
<code>boss</code> can be helpful to see what blacksmith services are running or to
troubleshoot provisioning services outside of a Cloud Foundry or
Kubernetes cluster. Blacksmith, like all Cloud Foundry service brokers,
conforms to OSB. So, you can use other service broker tools to interact
with Blacksmith, such as <a href="https://github.com/starkandwayne/eden">eden</a>. However, <code>boss</code> is designed specifically
for Blacksmith which provides it some advantages, such as being able to see
all services provisioned by Blacksmith, provisioned via <code>boss</code> or otherwise.</p>
<p>Installation is simple, download the binary for
your environment from the most recent <a href="https://github.com/jhunt/boss/releases">release</a>, and
it put in your PATH as <code>boss</code>.</p>
<h2>Using <code>boss</code> with your Blacksmith</h2>
<p>Using <code>boss</code> as a Genesis addon, there is no setup required. Genesis will
hand the creds to <code>boss</code> for the Blacksmith deployment. This can be helpful if
you are running multiple blacksmiths. You can quickly go between them by
allowing genesis to handle the creds for each deployment.</p>
<pre><code>$ genesis do my-env boss [command]
$ genesis do my-dev-env boss [command]
$ genesis do my-prod-env boss [command]
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to be able to use <code>boss</code> independently of Genesis, you can do
that, too. The easiest way is to export a few environment variables. You
can find the info for these using genesis.</p>
<pre><code>$ genesis info my-env

 ...

blacksmith web management UI
  web url:   http://10.128.80.129:3000
  username:  blacksmith
  password:  ...

 ...

$ export BLACKSMITH_URL=http://10.128.80.129:3000
$ export BLACKSMITH_USERNAME=blacksmith
$ export BLACKSMITH_PASSWORD= ...
</code></pre>
<p><code>boss</code> also supports these being passed in as command line arguments.</p>
<pre><code>-U, --url       (required) URL of Blacksmith
                Defaults to $BLACKSMITH_URL

-u, --username  (required) Blacksmith username.
                Defaults to $BLACKSMITH_USERNAME

-p, --password  (required) Blacksmith password.
                Defaults to $BLACKSMITH_PASSWORD
</code></pre>
<h2>Provisioning Services via <code>boss</code></h2>
<p><code>boss</code> allows you to bypass Cloud Foundry or Kubernetes and create
services directly in Blacksmith. This can be extremely useful in
debugging and diagnosing service related issues, especially if
Cloud Foundry or Kubenetes seem to be responsible for some
strange behavior.</p>
<p>That said, be sure use this tool responsibly. Services provisioned via <code>boss</code> are
done so directly with the Blacksmith broker. These services <em><strong>will</strong></em> appear in the
Blacksmith Management UI and these services <em><strong>will</strong></em> still count against
your service quotas, but <em><strong>will not</strong></em> show up in <code>cf services</code>. This can
make services provisioned using this tool easy to forget about, so remember to
clean up after yourself when debugging in this manor.</p>
<p>To see what services are available, use <code>boss catalog</code></p>
<pre><code>$ genesis do my-env boss catalog
Running boss addon for my-env

</code></pre>
<h2>Using <code>boss</code> to Interact with Services</h2>
<p>To see what services are running, use <code>boss list</code>. This list all services
provisioned on the specified Blacksmith, <code>boss</code> provisioned or otherwise.</p>
<pre><code>$ genesis do my-env boss list

</code></pre>
<p>You can get information about a service using the commands: <code>boss creds</code>,
<code>boss manifest</code>, and <code>boss task</code>.</p>
<p><code>boss creds</code> and <code>boss task</code> can throw a <code>500</code> error. <code>creds</code>
will not work until the service is fully deployed and <code>task</code> needs the
deployment task to have started before it will return properly.</p>

<h2>Cleaning Up After <code>boss</code></h2>
<p>This is a reminder that services provisioned with <code>boss</code> <em><strong>will not</strong></em>
show up in <code>cf services</code>, but <em><strong>will</strong></em> count against your service quotas.
Luckily, cleaning up is easy using <code>boss delete</code></p>
<pre><code>$ genesis do my-env.yml boss delete jolly-minsky
Running boss addon for my-env
jolly-minsky instance deleted.
</code></pre>
<h2>Troubleshoot Service Failures</h2>
<p>If a service fails to deploy, Cloud Foundry users will not get
much detail from Cloud Foundry itself.  This is a self-protective
measure taken by the Blacksmith system itself, to avoid leaking
sensitive implementation details.</p>
<p>As an operator, you have access to the deployment log for the
service, if you know the internal UUID/GUID that Cloud Foundry has
assigned to the service instance.</p>
<p>This can be found by running:</p>
<pre><code>$ cf service --guid service-name
</code></pre>
<p>From the Blacksmith Management Web UI, go to the <em>Services</em>
section and look for the entry in the table that corresponds to
the service GUID.  The deployment log can be reached by the
<code>task.log</code> link.</p>
<p><img src="images/services/services.png" alt="Services Section"></p>
<p>The task log is what you would have seen had you deployed this
service yourself, manually, via <code>bosh deploy</code> or <code>genesis deploy</code>:</p>
<pre><code>Task 15 | 20:54:31 | Preparing deployment: Preparing deployment started
Task 15 | 20:54:31 | Preparing deployment: Preparing deployment failed
Task 15 | 20:54:31 | ERROR: [50003] Stemcell with Operating System 'ubuntu-trusty' doesn't exist
</code></pre>
<p>In this case, the stemcell hasnâ€™t been uploaded.  Oops.</p>
<h2>Retrieve Service Credentials as an Operator</h2>
<p>From the Blacksmith Management Web UI, you can access the full and
unredacted deployment manifest by clicking on the <code>manifest.yml</code>
link in the <em>Services</em> section.</p>
<p><img src="images/services/services.png" alt="Services Section"></p>
<p>The credentials are stored in the manifest:</p>

</code></pre>
<p>This manifest has been mangled by machines, so itâ€™s not the most
legible thing in the world.</p>
<h2>Retrieve Service Credentials as an End User</h2>
<p>Cloud Foundry users should use <code>cf service my-service</code> and
inspect the contents of the <code>VCAP_SERVICES</code> environment variable
JSON to determine their service credentials.</p>
<h2>Target the Blacksmith BOSH Director</h2>
<p>Blacksmith deploys all of its service deployments by way of an
internal BOSH director, separate from all of your other BOSH
directors.  This internal director lives on the Blacksmith broker
VM itself.</p>
<p>For more advanced troubleshooting, you may need to SSH into a VM
on a service deployment.  To do that, you first need to target
that director.</p>
<p>Run the <code>bosh</code> Genesis addon:</p>
<pre><code>$ genesis do my-env bosh
Running bosh addon for my-env
Logging you in as user 'admin'...
Using environment 'https://10.128.80.129:25555'

Username (): admin
Password ():

Using environment 'https://10.128.80.129:25555' as client 'admin'

Logged in to 'https://10.128.80.129:25555'

Succeeded
</code></pre>
<p>From there, you can run all the normal BOSH commands against the
director.  You can SSH into deployments, check VM health, etc.</p>
<p>All of your tasks will be attributed to the <code>admin</code> user.
Blacksmith itself uses the <code>blacksmith</code> user so as not to confuse
things.</p>
<h2>Update the stemcell of a running service</h2>
<p>Blacksmith deploys all of its service deployments by way of an
internal BOSH director. So the servicesâ€™ stemcells are managed by that internal BOSH director.
To update the stemcell of any running service, you have to first target the internal BOSH director
as mention above.</p>
<p>Upload to the internal BOSH director the stemcell you wish to update to by running:</p>
<pre><code>bosh -e blacksmith-bosh-env-name upload-stemcell --sha1 7734f7ef195dacc369802dee785a320ca6512383 \
  https://bosh.io/d/stemcells/bosh-vsphere-esxi-ubuntu-bionic-go_agent?v=1.91
</code></pre>
<p>Next get the manifest of the running service by running:</p>
<pre><code>bosh -e blacksmith-bosh-env-name -d service-deployment-name manifest &gt; service-deployment-name.yml
</code></pre>
<p>Edit the stemcell section of service-deployment-name.yml:</p>
<pre><code>stemcells:
- alias: &quot;default&quot;
  os: &quot;ubuntu-bionic&quot;
  version: &quot;1.91&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Save service-deployment-name.yml.</p>
<p>Redeploy the service by running:</p>
<pre><code>bosh -e blacksmith-bosh-env-name -d service-deployment-name deploy service-deployment-name.yml
</code></pre>
<p>Note: BOSH will stop the service, wait for the process to finish, then terminate the stemcell, boot the new service and attach the disk and start it.</p>
